/*
82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II

Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
Output: [1,2,5]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]
Output: [2,3]

// Initial approach
/*
Time Complexity: O(N)
    Even if we have a while nested loop, this isn't a quadratic algorithm. 
    The nested while loop still increments N times (if duplicates are found) so
    that we can point the placeholder dummy node to remove all duplicates.
Space Complexity: O(1)

var deleteDuplicates = function (head) {
  if (!head) return head;
  // Create a dummy head node
  let dummy = new ListNode(0, head);
  // Create a placeholder for the dummy head
  let currDummy = dummy;
  let curr = head;
  let next = head.next;

  while (next) {
    // if the value of curr === value of next enter while loop
    if (next !== null && curr.val === next.val) {
        // while the curr val === next val keep looping
      while (next !== null && curr.val === next.val) {
        // increment the next pointer
        next = next.next;
        // while icrementing the next pointer, make sure to move the curr pointer behind it 
        // so that we know when to exit loop
        curr.next = next;
      }
      // once loop exits, let the placeholder dummy node point to the next node
      // the placeholder dummy node will stay behind the curr node
